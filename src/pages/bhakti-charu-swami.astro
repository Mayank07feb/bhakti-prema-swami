            HH Bhakti Charu Swami Maharaja was born into an aristocratic Bengali
            family on 17th September 1945 in Kuti, Brahmanbaria District, Bengal
            Presidency (now Bangladesh). He spent most of his childhood in urban
            Kolkata. Leaving India in 1970 in pursuit of further education, he
            attended university in Germany to study Chemistry. However, after
            some time he felt rather dissatisfied with Western culture and so he
            returned to India in search of a spiritual teacher.After an
            extensive but fruitless search in the Himalaya region of Northern
            India, he returned to Kolkata in 1976. Upon receiving a visit from
            his old friend Prasun who had joined the ISKCON temple in Kolkata
            and become Sarvabhavana Dasa, they attended the temple
            together.After a few visits to the temple Maharaja wanted to
            purchase a copy of Bhagavad-gita, but since the temple did not have
            a copy on hand, he accepted a copy of Srila Prabhupada's English
            translation of Srila Rupa Goswami's Nectar of Devotion
            (Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu). Maharaja himself recounted on many
            occasions how this book completely changed his life.

            After reading Nectar of Devotion and feeling that he had found his
            spiritual teacher, he dreamt of Srila Prabhupada and His Holiness
            decided to join ISKCON in Sridham Mayapura in the second half of
            1976. His first contact with Srila Prabhupada was during the
            Kumbha-mela festival in January 1977 and when Srila Prabhupada left
            the festival by train Bhavananda Maharaja arranged his first
            personal meeting. In that meeting Srila Prabhupada asked His
            Holiness to translate all his books into Bengali. From that time
            onwards Maharaja became part of Srila Prabhupada's personal
            entourage and Prabhupada appointed him his secretary for Indian
            affairs. During the Mayapura Gaura Purnima festival in March of 1977
            His Holiness received first and second initiation and soon
            afterwards, during the Snana Yatra festival in Vrindavana, Srila
            Prabhupada awarded Maharaja sannyasa initiation.

            His Holiness remained a member of Srila Prabhupada's personal
            entourage until his departure in November 1977. After Srila
            Prabhupada's disappearance Maharaja took on a leading role in
            establishing the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust in Kolkata and Mayapura
            and continued to translate Srila Prabhupada's major works into
            Bengali. In 1987 he became a member of the Governing Body Commission
            and an initiating spiritual master. Thereafter he travelled
            extensively around the globe and became a leading exponent of Vedic
            wisdom in the line of Gaudiya Vaishnavism. In 1995 Maharaja began
            work on his multi-episode serial Abhay Charan depicting the life and
            teachings of Srila Prabhupada. In 1996, Srila Prabhupada's
            centennial year, he completed the translation of Srila Prabhupada's
            books into Bengali and arranged for the screening of the Abhay
            Charan serial on Indian television reaching an audience of several
            million.

          In 2005 Maharaja began work to establish a centre in Ujjain, India,
          and in just 10 months completed the temple structure which houses
          beautiful Deities of Sri Sri Radha-Madana-mohana, Krishna-Balarama and
          Gaura-Nitai. Maharaja also established temples in Panihati, Northern
          Kolkata and Kuti, Bangladesh. Most recently Maharaja established a
          farm community in Deland, Florida in the United States.
