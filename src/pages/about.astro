            On 1st September 1896, Abhay Charan Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila
            Prabhupada was born in a Hindu family. After a few decades, he met
            the well-known religious leader and scholar Shri Srila
            Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur in 1922, who educated Abhay Charan
            to introduce the philosophies of Lord Krishna to the West. The
            influence of Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati's philosophy became a
            turning point in his life. In 1933, Srila Prabhupada became a
            follower of Srila Bhaktisiddhanta and spent the next 32 years making
            his journey toward the western countries to fulfill his mentor's
            command.

            At 69, Srila Prabhupada put his footsteps in New York City with only
            Rs40 in his pocket, a trunk full of books, and some personal
            belongings. He faced great hardships, and the journey was
            treacherous without any money to survive and a steady place to live.
            But Srila Prabhupada remained determined and didn't give up. Thus,
            he began his mission humbly by giving classes on the Bhagavad-gita
            in lofts in the Bowery (New York's infamous skid row) and leading
            kirtan (traditional devotional chants) in Tompkins Square Park.

            Srila Prabhupada's message of peace and goodwill resonated strongly
            with the hippie community and younger generation; some even came
            forward to become serious students of the Bhakti-yoga (loving
            devotion to God) tradition. With the help of his students and
            followers, he rented a small piece of land and registered his
            organization officially. On 11th July 1966, he formally established
            the ISKCON or International Society for Krishna Consciousness. In
            the next 11 years, he circled the entire world around 14 times and
            conveyed the teachings of Lord Krishna to countless people on six
            different continents.

        Srila Prabhupada came back to India with a wish to cultivate the better
        roots of Lord Krishna. He opened numerous temples and one of the largest
        centers of ISKCON in the holy towns of Mayapur and Vrindavana. The most
        imperative contribution of Srila Prabhupada is conceivably his books. He
        wrote more than 70 volumes on the tradition of Krishna, which scholars
        highly appreciate because of its depth, clarity, and faithfulness toward
        the tradition. Several colleges have used his work in textbooks, and all
        his books have been already translated into 76 different languages.
