            Bhakti Prema Swami Maharaj was born on 31st December 1967 and was
            raised in a traditional gaudiya vaishnava culture. Maharaj came in
            contact with ISKCON in 1994, and in his very first meeting with his

            Maharaj. He served as the Head of the Medical Department in Mayapur
            Temple from 1996 to 2001 and as a Brahmacari counselor from 1997 to
            2001. In 2000, he completed the Bhakti Sastri Course and
            subsequently taught the same under MIHE University. In 2001, he was
            asked to serve as the Vice President of ISKCON Kolkata (WB) and
            served in that capacity till 2004. During those three years he was

          After becoming aware of one specific desire of Srila Bhaktisiddhanta
          Saraswati — to have student hostels to guide them in Krishna
          Consciousness — Maharaj established BSC – Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati
          Chattravas (Spiritual Student Hostels) to preach Krishna Consciousness
          effectively to the youth. Around 18 such youth preaching centers are
          effectively functioning under his guidance in central India.

          His uniqueness is in his melodious Vaisnava bhajans with beautiful
          purports and his humble, loving relationships with everyone who comes
          in contact. His future preaching plans involve youth preaching
          programs, developing devotee village communities, establishing Vedic
          education and culture for sustained community growth, and traveling
          worldwide to propagate Krishna Consciousness.
